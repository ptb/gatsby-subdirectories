* Gatsby Subdirectories

This is my answer to how to build gatsby assets into subdirectories under public: [[https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/3760][gatsbyjs/gatsby#3760]]

It's just my personal preferences how I like to structure my files and post-install patch the files under node_modules.

To test:

#+begin_src sh
git clone https://github.com/ptb/gatsby-subdirectories.git
npm install
npm run build
#+end_src
